      "description": "This pathway is similar to a college level program in illustration and visual arts. To prove competency in this pathway, deep understanding and skill mastery will be required. Completion of this pathway could easily take years. Learners should expect to practice drawing, painting, digital art, writing, research, and learn tools to get started in the art industry. Learners should also consider reaching out to peers or experts for feedback, as receiving feedback and implementing changes is one of the best ways to grow as an artist."
